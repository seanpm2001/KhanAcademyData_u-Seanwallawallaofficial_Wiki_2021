# The projects new purpose (June 9th 2020)

[Go back](https://github.com/seanpm2001/KhanAcademyData_u-Seanwallawallaofficial/wiki/)

When I originally started this project, I only had 1 thing in mind, which was dumping my [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) scripts and never touching this project again, except for adding [DE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment) support and fixing 1 bug.

After wrapping up and while doing something later on, I thought of a great new idea for this project, which is to keep a copy of my [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) daily consecutive day screenshots. So later on the night of June 9th 2020, I started doing that, and now the project has a new purpose.

I will now update this project on either a daily, or a whenever-I-feel-like-it basis. The scripts will always remain, and the screenshots will remain separate.
