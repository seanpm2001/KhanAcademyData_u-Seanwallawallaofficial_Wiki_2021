# My Khan Academy strategy

[Go back](https://github.com/seanpm2001/KhanAcademyData_u-Seanwallawallaofficial/wiki/)

I originally didn't have much of a strategy when I started my main Khan Academy count on May 30th 2017, but I developed a strategy quickly, where I would watch 1 video a day, and read the articles that came after it before the next video. I would also do a test every once in a while. This way, I can learn a little bit each day and save more for later.
